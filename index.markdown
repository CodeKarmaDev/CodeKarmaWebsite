To consistently make good websites
I seek first to understand your needs and limitations.
Then we look for an approach that will server those need.


The point of this is to define your softwares goal and marks for success.


<!-- If your project is customer facing, 
it might be important that your website looks amazing and makes an impression.
or maybe this feature is built to help employees to handled orders. 
I would be best if the user interface was fact and easy to use.  -->


Once we have a target to hit its time to execute.

By following best practices and industry standards,
I keep the code maintainable, 
and I make development fast and agile.


Throughout the development process we test the product against those marker we defined earlier. 
We optimize it as we go.


The end will be an awesome website that fits your needs.
