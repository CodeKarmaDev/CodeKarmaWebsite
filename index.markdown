When your needs change, you will want your code to change. 
Thats why I make decisions now that will save time, money, and effort later.
Its what I like to call **Code Karma**.


Build good karma does not require anything fancy or complicated.
- I ensure that we are solving the right problem
by taking a little extra time to understand the clients needs. 
- I avoid known pitfalls
by spending a few minutes researching solutions.
- I give my clients more options by
keeping my code maintainable
and committing to good development practices.
