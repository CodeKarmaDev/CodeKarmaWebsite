Hi, I'm **Sean Ferney**. I love building software that solves your problems and fits your needs.

ok what does my homepage need to do:
- call to action to see my services
- call to action to get estimate
- call to action see my portfolio | later
 



When your needs change, 
I think your website should be able to change with you.
Thats why I make decisions that will save you time, money, and effort.
Its what I like to call **Code Karma**.


1. I ensure that we are solving the right problem
by taking a little extra time to understand your needs. 
2. I give my clients more options by
keeping my code maintainable
and committing to good development practices.
3. I avoid known pitfalls
by spending a few minutes researching solutions.
