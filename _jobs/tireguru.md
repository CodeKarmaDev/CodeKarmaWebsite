The projects at Tireguru where the most complex I have worked on. I worked on various in-house integrations, a payment integration, the software architecture, queue management, UX/UI, a handful of features, and some strategic refactoring.

- Quickly became proficient with Angular, PHP, and Laravel.
- Significantly reduced error counts.
- Improved and maintained test coverage.
