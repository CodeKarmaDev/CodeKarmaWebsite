SALSA is a online syllabus management tool. I am currently the sole active developer on it. I work 100% remotely, I maintain the software, I build or refining features, and do a little tech support when needed.

- Reliably solved technical problems.
- Worked independently.
- Refined and communicated design specifications.
- Built 6+ features.
- Fulfilled my requirements and deadlines.
